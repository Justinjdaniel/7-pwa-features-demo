# PWA Features Demo & Modern Web Capabilities

This repository showcases a collection of Progressive Web App (PWA) features and other modern web-platform capabilities. It serves as a practical demonstration of how these technologies can be used to build rich, engaging, and native-like web applications.

Originally titled "Seven web-platform features you didn't know existed," this project has expanded to include even more examples.

## Features Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following web features:

*   **Background Sync:** Enables web applications to defer actions until the user has stable network connectivity.
*   **Bluetooth API:** Allows web applications to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.
*   **Camera Access:** Shows how to access device cameras for capturing images or video.
*   **Contact Picker API:** Provides a secure way for users to share contacts from their address book with web applications.
*   **Device Motion & Orientation:** Accesses device accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.
*   **File System Access API:** Allows web applications to interact directly with files and folders on the user's local device.
*   **GPS (Geolocation API):** Enables web applications to request and use the user's geographical location.
*   **Idle Detection API:** Notifies the application when a user is idle.
*   **Web Sharing API:** Allows web content to be shared to other applications or services using the native sharing capabilities of the device.
*   **Web Authentication (WebAuthn):** Enables strong, public-key cryptography-based authentication, including support for passwordless login and multi-factor authentication.
*   **Push Notifications:** Demonstrates how service workers can receive and display push messages.
*   **Service Worker Lifecycle:** Implements a service worker for caching, offline capabilities, and background tasks.

## Key PWA Benefits Highlighted

*   **Offline Support:** Service workers enable core functionality to work even without a network connection.
*   **Installability:** Users can add the application to their home screen for easy access.
*   **Native-Like Experiences:** Access to device hardware and features like push notifications blur the lines between web and native apps.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** PWAs run across various devices and platforms from a single codebase.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally on your machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Justinjdaniel/7-pwa-features-demo.git
    cd 7-pwa-features-demo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts Vite's development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Build for production:**
    This command bundles the application and generates the service worker for production. Output is in the `dist/` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Preview the production build:**
    This command serves the `dist/` directory locally to test the production build.
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## Service Worker Customization

The service worker (`sw.js`) is initially generated by Workbox during the build process. Following this, the `append-sw-push-listener.js` script is executed to add custom push and background sync event listeners. This script is idempotent, meaning it checks if the listeners already exist (using marker comments like `// --- Appended Push Event Listener ---`) before appending them, preventing duplication if the build process is run multiple times.

## Project Structure (Brief Overview)

*   `src/`: Contains the main application source code.
    *   `src/app/`: JavaScript modules for each demonstrated feature.
    *   `src/index.html`: The main HTML entry point.
    *   `src/main.js`: The main JavaScript entry point.
*   `public/`: Static assets that are copied directly to the build output.
*   `dist/`: The production build output directory.
*   `docs/`: Contains additional documentation (currently mostly placeholders).
*   `append-sw-push-listener.js`: Script to customize the service worker.
*   `vite.config.js`: Vite build configuration.
*   `workbox-config.js`: Workbox service worker generation configuration.

## Further Resources & Documentation

*   The `docs/` directory in this repository contains further (though currently basic) documentation on PWA concepts and core features.
*   [web.dev by Google](https://web.dev/) for extensive resources on PWAs and modern web capabilities.
*   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) for PWA documentation.
